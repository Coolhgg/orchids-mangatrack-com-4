# QA Comprehensive Review Report

**Date:** January 15, 2026  
**Framework:** Next.js 15 with TypeScript  
**Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase) + Prisma ORM  
**Cache:** Redis

---

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive QA review was conducted on the Kenmei codebase. The review identified several issues across security, input validation, error handling, and edge cases. All critical issues have been addressed, and new integration tests have been added.

---

## Bug Fixes Applied

### 1. Feed Activity Route - Input Validation (CRITICAL)

**File:** `src/app/api/feed/activity/route.ts`

**Issue:** The `filter` parameter was not validated against a whitelist, allowing potential injection attacks through string concatenation in SQL queries.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `VALID_FILTERS` whitelist: `Set(['all', 'unread'])`
- Filter value now validated before use
- Invalid filters default to 'all'

**Issue:** The `limit` parameter was not properly validated for NaN.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added NaN check: `isNaN(rawLimit) ? 30 : rawLimit`
- Bounded to 1-100 range

**Issue:** Cursor parsing could expose error details.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive cursor structure validation
- UUID format validation for cursor ID
- Date format validation for cursor timestamp
- Silent failure on invalid cursors (no error exposure)

**Issue:** Cache JSON parsing could fail silently.

**Fix Applied:**
- Wrapped cache JSON.parse in try/catch
- Graceful degradation on corrupted cache

**Issue:** Empty chapterIds array could cause unnecessary DB query.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added check: `if (chapterIds.length > 0)`

**Issue:** Cache write failures could crash the request.

**Fix Applied:**
- Wrapped cache set in try/catch with warning log

## Security Assessment

### Passing Security Controls

| Control | Status | Evidence |
|---------|--------|----------|
| UUID Validation | PASS | All ID parameters validated with regex |
| SQL Injection Prevention | PASS | Parameterized queries, ILIKE escaping |
| XSS Prevention | PASS | `sanitizeInput()` strips dangerous patterns |
| CSRF Protection | PASS | Origin validation on mutating endpoints |
| Rate Limiting | PASS | Redis-based with in-memory fallback |
| Open Redirect Prevention | PASS | `getSafeRedirect()` whitelist validation |
| Content-Type Validation | PASS | `validateContentType()` on all POST/PATCH |
| JSON Size Limits | PASS | `validateJsonSize()` prevents large payloads |
| Auth Token Handling | PASS | Supabase auth with secure cookies |

### XP Integrity Controls

| Rule | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| XP_PER_CHAPTER = 1 | PASS | Constant locked, tested |
| XP_SERIES_COMPLETED = 100 | PASS | Constant locked, tested |
| No bulk XP multipliers | PASS | Single XP per progress action |
| Achievement XP once-only | PASS | Unique constraint + application check |
| Concurrent request safety | PASS | DB unique constraint catches races |

## Test Files Added/Updated

### New Test File: `src/__tests__/integration/qa-api-security.test.ts`

**39 tests covering:**
- UUID validation (valid, invalid, SQL injection)
- Input sanitization (XSS, scripts, event handlers)
- ILIKE pattern escaping
- Open redirect prevention
- Rate limiting functionality
- XP integrity constants
- Level calculation safety
- Unicode handling (Japanese, Korean, emoji)
- XSS bypass attempts (double encoding, mixed case, null bytes)
- Cursor pagination security
- Filter value validation

### Existing Test File: `src/__tests__/integration/achievement-xp-qa.test.ts`

**11 tests covering Achievement XP QA Matrix:**
1. First Chapter Read - achievement unlocks, XP granted once
2. Repeat Chapter Reads - no new XP, no duplicate achievement
3. Threshold Achievement - speed_reader at 100 chapters
4. Status Toggle Abuse - XP granted once only
5. Concurrent Requests - achievement unlocked once
6. Re-run checkAchievements - no XP granted
7. XP_PER_CHAPTER constant integrity
8. XP_SERIES_COMPLETED constant integrity
9. first_chapter achievement xp_reward
10. speed_reader achievement xp_reward
11. user_achievements unique constraint

## Recommendations

### Immediate (P0)
- All critical bugs fixed in this session

### Short-term (P1)
- Add integration tests for all remaining API routes
- Implement request logging for security audit trail
- Add automated dependency vulnerability scanning

### Medium-term (P2)
- Implement request tracing (correlation IDs)
- Add health check endpoint monitoring
- Consider adding API versioning

## Test Execution Results

```
qa-api-security.test.ts: 39 pass, 0 fail
achievement-xp-qa.test.ts: 11 pass, 0 fail
```

All tests passing.
