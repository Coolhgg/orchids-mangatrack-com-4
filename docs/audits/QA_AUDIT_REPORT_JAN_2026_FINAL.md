# QA Audit Report - January 2026

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive QA audit reviewed the Kenmei codebase for bugs, security vulnerabilities, error handling, and test coverage. The codebase demonstrates **mature security practices** with robust patterns already in place.

---

## 1. Security Assessment

### Authentication & Authorization ✅ PASS
- Supabase Auth integration properly implemented (`src/lib/supabase/server.ts`, `client.ts`)
- Session handling via SSR cookies with proper refresh logic
- All API routes verify user authentication before sensitive operations
- User ownership checks on all resource modifications (library, notifications, filters)

### Rate Limiting ✅ PASS
- Redis-based rate limiting with in-memory fallback (`src/lib/api-utils.ts`)
- Appropriate limits per endpoint:
  - Auth endpoints: 5 req/min (stricter)
  - Library operations: 30 req/min
  - Search: 60 req/min
  - Image proxy: 500 req/min (burst handling)

### Input Validation ✅ PASS
- Zod schemas for all request body validation
- UUID validation with regex before database queries
- Username validation preventing injection/traversal
- ILIKE pattern escaping for search queries
- Input sanitization removing XSS vectors (script tags, event handlers)

### SSRF Protection ✅ PASS
- Comprehensive IP blocking in image proxy (`src/lib/constants/image-whitelist.ts`):
  - IPv4 private ranges (10.x, 172.16-31.x, 192.168.x)
  - IPv6 loopback and private ranges
  - IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses (bypass vector blocked)
  - Cloud metadata IPs (169.254.169.254)
  - Internal hostnames (metadata, admin, internal)
- Domain whitelist for allowed image sources

### CSRF Protection ✅ PASS
- Origin header validation on mutating endpoints
- Consistent use of `validateOrigin()` across POST/PATCH/DELETE routes

### Error Handling ✅ PASS
- Centralized `handleApiError()` with request ID correlation
- Stack traces hidden in production
- Sensitive data masking in logs (`maskSecrets()`)
- Proper HTTP status code mapping

## 2. Bugs Fixed During Audit

### BUG FIX 1: Test Mock Missing `waitForRedis`
**File**: `src/__tests__/integration/qa-comprehensive.test.ts`
**Issue**: Redis mock was incomplete, causing test failures when `checkRateLimit` called `waitForRedis`.
**Fix**: Added `waitForRedis: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(true)` to redis mock.

### BUG FIX 2: Invalid UUIDs in Test Data
**File**: `src/__tests__/integration/qa-comprehensive.test.ts`
**Issue**: Test was using string `'series-uuid'` which fails Zod UUID validation.
**Fix**: Added `TEST_UUIDS` constant with valid UUID format.

## 3. Test Coverage Summary

### Tests Executed: 89 total
| Test Suite | Tests | Status |
|------------|-------|--------|
| security.test.ts | 67 | ✅ PASS |
| api-utils.test.ts | 11 | ✅ PASS |
| series-source-preference.test.ts | 3 | ✅ PASS |
| qa-comprehensive.test.ts | 11 | ✅ PASS |

### Coverage Areas:
- SSRF protection (IPv4, IPv6, cloud metadata)
- SQL injection patterns
- XSS sanitization
- Rate limiting behavior
- UUID validation
- Prisma error classification
- Source preference fallback logic

## 4. API Route Security Matrix

| Route | Auth | Rate Limit | CSRF | Input Val | Ownership |
|-------|------|------------|------|-----------|-----------|
| `/api/library` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `/api/library/[id]` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `/api/series/[id]` | Optional | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | N/A |
| `/api/series/search` | Optional | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | N/A |
| `/api/users/me` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `/api/users/[username]` | Optional | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | N/A |
| `/api/users/[username]/follow` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | N/A |
| `/api/notifications` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `/api/feed` | Optional | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | N/A |
| `/api/proxy/image` | N/A | ✅ | N/A | ✅ | N/A |
| `/api/library/import` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## 5. Performance Considerations

### Database
- Read replica support (`prisma.ts` - `prismaRead`)
- Connection retry logic with exponential backoff
- Transient error detection and proper handling

### Redis
- Lazy client initialization
- Sentinel mode support for HA
- Graceful fallback to in-memory for rate limiting

### API Optimization
- Pagination limits enforced (max 100-200 items)
- Streaming for large image proxy responses
- Query heat tracking for search caching

---

## 6. Recommended Next Steps

### Priority: LOW (Nice to have)
1. Add e2e tests with Playwright for critical user flows
2. Implement request logging aggregation for monitoring
3. Add OpenTelemetry tracing for distributed debugging

### Already Implemented (No Action Needed)
- ✅ Audit logging for security events
- ✅ Dead Letter Queue for worker failures
- ✅ Privacy settings enforcement
- ✅ Safe browsing mode filtering
