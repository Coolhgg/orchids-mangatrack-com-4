## Index Recommendations

### Existing Critical Indexes

```sql
-- User lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_users_username ON users(username);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_xp_desc ON users(xp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_users_season_xp_desc ON users(season_xp DESC);

-- Library queries
CREATE INDEX idx_library_entries_user_status_lastread 
    ON library_entries(user_id, status, last_read_at DESC);

-- Feed queries
CREATE INDEX idx_feed_entries_discovered_desc 
    ON feed_entries(first_discovered_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_feed_entries_lastupdated_series 
    ON feed_entries(last_updated_at DESC, series_id);

-- Chapter lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_chapters_series_number_desc 
    ON chapters(series_id, chapter_number DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_chapters_published_desc 
    ON chapters(published_at DESC, id DESC);

-- Read tracking
CREATE INDEX idx_user_chapter_reads_v2_user_updated 
    ON user_chapter_reads_v2(user_id, updated_at DESC);

-- Activity feed
CREATE INDEX idx_activities_user_created 
    ON activities(user_id, created_at DESC);
```

## Performance Notes

1. **Cursor Pagination:** Use `(sort_column, id)` composite cursors for stable pagination
2. **Array Operators:** Use `@>` (contains) and `&&` (overlaps) for genre/tag filters
3. **Partial Indexes:** Consider `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` partial indexes for active records
4. **JSONB:** Use `jsonb_agg` for multi-source chapter data to reduce round trips
5. **Window Functions:** Use `ROW_NUMBER()` for leaderboards instead of subqueries
6. **Trust Score:** Always multiply XP by `trust_score` for leaderboard calculations
